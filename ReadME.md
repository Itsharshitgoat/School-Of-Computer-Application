# School Of Computer Application

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my **School Of Computer Application Repository**. This is a collection of all the code I've written throughout my college years—projects, assignments, experiments, and everything in between. Every file here has a story, a lesson learned, and a memory attached to it. Whether it's an algorithm I struggled with, a project I’m proud of, or something I just had fun building, it's all here.

## Why I Created This Repo

When I first started coding, I had no idea where it would take me. Over time, it’s become more than just lines of code; it's become a reflection of my growth as a developer. Every pull request, every commit, every bug fixed has made me a little bit better. And now, this repository is where I get to share that journey with you.

I built this repo to keep track of all my work in one place, so I can look back on it and see how far I've come. But it's also here for you—whether you’re a fellow student, a developer, or someone who’s just interested in the kind of stuff I’m working on. My hope is that you find something useful, learn from my mistakes, or even build on what I've started.

## What's Inside?

- **Assignments**: The core of my learning journey. Some simple, others a bit more complicated, but they all helped shape how I think about coding.
- **Projects**: These are more like the fun stuff—the bigger challenges that I poured my time and energy into.
- **Experiments**: Some code that may not be “perfect” but helped me test ideas or learn new things.
